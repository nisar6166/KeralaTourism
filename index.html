                <img src="./Images/keraladistricttourismmap.jpg" alt="kerala District Tourism Map">
                <p>Kerala is situated at the southwestern end of the Indian subcontinent. Kerala has a long history of
                    art and cultural heritage and foreign trade with other countries. The state with the highest
                    literacy rate in India is noted for its achievements in education, health, gender equality, social
                    justice, law and order. In addition to these, the state has the lowest infant mortality rate in the
                    country. Kerala lies between the Arabian Sea in the West and the Western Ghats (Sahyadris) in the
                    East with an area of 38863 sq km. It is one of the five states in the linguistic-cultural area known
                    as South India. The neighbouring states of Kerala are Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Mayyazhi (Mahe /
                    Mahe) is a part of Pondicherry (Puducherry) and lies within Kerala. Though the Lakshadweep in the
                    Arabian Sea is part of the Union Territories, it has a close alliance with the linguistic and
                    cultural heritage of Kerala.
